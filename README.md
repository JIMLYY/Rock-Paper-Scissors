# Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction
* The game Rock Paper Scissors is a worldwide game. This game can even be tracked back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD)
of ancient China, contemporary with Roman Empire! It is called jian dao, shi tou, bu in China, pierre-papier-ciseaux or chifoumi in France; roshambo in parts of the U.S., taş kağıt makas in Turkey, and jan-ken-pon in Japan. Today, Rock Paper Scissors is still a popular game not only for fun but also as a way to set dispute. In this project, I built a program that 
plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors by implementing Python and object-oriented programming skills. 

## Instruction 
In this project, I wrote computer players wtih different strategies, and a human player class that lets a human play the 
game against the computer. If you want to play this game:
1. clone this repository to local computer by running in your terminal:
-  ```git clone https://github.com/JIMLYY/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git``` 
1. ensure python3 has installed
2. open the file ```rock_paper_scissors.py```

## Want to try if for yourself
Starter code has been provided. 
1. open ```starter_code.py```
2. start coding
